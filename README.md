# crack_file

There is vulnerable programm, made by my team-mate. Program requires password and shows the message, that indicates about success or failure. The goal is to achieve the output of the passphrase of a successful password entry. First stage is to find a couple of vulnerabilites and use them to show the "success" message. Second stage is to make binary patch for hacking target-programm. I have written patch with help of the Qt lib.
